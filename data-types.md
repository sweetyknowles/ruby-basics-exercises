### Assorted Data Types

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?
* Make a guess before testing your answer.
* "Error out" is a valid answer choice.
* Also include a sentence on why you chose your answer.

```rb
2 ** 3
```
```text
8
```

```rb
((16 / 4) * (2 + 1)) ** 2
```
```text
144
```

```rb
("a milli " + "a milli") * 3
```
```text
"a milli a millia milli a millia milli a milli"
```

```rb
("a milli " * 4) / 2
```
```text
NoMethodError: undefined method `/' for "a milli a milli a milli a milli ":String
```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: " + my_favorite_number
```
```text
TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String
```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: #{my_favorite_number}"
```
```text
My favorite number is: 13
```

### Truthiness and Falsiness

#### Which of these evaluate as `false` in Ruby? Mark all that apply.

```text
[x] false
[ ] 0
[ ] ""
[ ] null
[ ] [ ] (empty array)
[ ] undefined
[ ] NaN
[x] nil
```

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?
* Make a guess before testing your answer.
* "Error out" is a valid answer choice.
* Also include a sentence on why you chose your answer.

```rb
name = gets.chomp
if name
  puts "My name is: " + name
end
```
```text
"My name is: Slim Shady"

This works because of ruby's ability to add two strings and the .chomp removing the line escape character.
```

```rb
no_name = ""
if no_name
  puts "My name is: " + name
end
```
```text
undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object (NameError)

Ruby does not have falsey for empty strings so the if conditional will run. The variable name is undefined so it will throw an error.
```

```rb
no_name = nil
if no_name
  puts "My name is: " + name
end
```
```text
Does nothing

The if conditional won't run because nil is falsey.
```

### Conditionals

#### Write FizzBuzz in Ruby!

Fizz-Buzz is a classic coding exercise that you can create using your knowledge of conditionals and loops. Implement code that does the following...

* Counts from 1 to 100 and prints out something for each number.
* If the number is divisible by 3, print `"Fizz"`.
* If the number is divisible by 5, print `"Buzz"`.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
* If the number does not meet any of the above conditions, just print the number.

Your output should look something like this...
```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
```

You technically haven't learned Ruby loops yet, so we started you off with one below. You should be able to make sense of it based on your experiences with Javascript. All you have to do is change the content of the loop.

```rb
i = 1
while i <= 100
  # Your code goes in here.
end
```
